Project Overview

This project leverages Rasa NLU, a popular open-source machine learning framework, to create a conversational bot capable of interpreting user input based on intents and entities. The therapy bot was designed to serve as a tool for people seeking conversational therapy or emotional support.

The bot performs the following:

Intent Recognition: It classifies the user's query (e.g., "I'm feeling sad" or "I need advice").
Entity Recognition: It can identify key details in user input, like emotions or specific topics (e.g., "feeling" and "sad").
Response Generation: Based on the recognized intents and entities, the bot generates responses that are relevant and empathetic.
While the bot is not a replacement for a real therapist, it can assist users by guiding them through conversation and providing feedback based on their inputs.

Setup Instructions

This bot has been specifically developed and tested to work with Python 3.10. As of now, it is not compatible with Python 3.12 due to some dependency conflicts. Therefore, it is recommended to use Python 3.10 to avoid issues.
